Advanced File Manager For Windows

    This is an advanced file manager which copies the files and folders
    of required extension and size to a user defined relocated destination
    folder.
    
    The main motivation for such a file explorer is to find out quickly
    and access the files which you used way back with help of partailly 
    attributes of it which you remember (like size or extension or 
    directory or substring of the filename)
